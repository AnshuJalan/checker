* Technical document can be found [here](https://hackmd.io/teMO2x9PRRy1iTBtrSMBvA?view).
* The contents of the interface file in the technical document have been slightly adjusted (so that compilation succeeds) and are placed in the [src folder](https://github.com/tweag/huxian/tree/main/src).
* Currently all the action is happening on the [monolithic/script.ml](https://github.com/tweag/huxian/blob/main/monolithic/script.ml) file.
