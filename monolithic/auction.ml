Utku: Lifecycle of liquidation slices.

1. When a 'liquidation_slice' is created from a burrow, it is
   added to the 'queued_slices' queue. This is backed by an AVL
   tree.

   Adding something to the tree returns a 'leaf_ptr'.  This needs to
   be stored in a FIFO queue inside the burrow. This queue needs to have an
   efficient prepend and append methods.

2. When checker is touched, and there is no existing auction
   going on, a prefix of the 'queued_slices' is split, and inserted
   as 'current_auction' alongside with the current timestamp. This
   process is efficient because of the AVL tree.

   When the prefix returned does not have as much tez as we
   want, this means that the next liquidation_slice in 'queued_slices'
   needs to be split. We can do this by popping the first item if exists,
   which as an invariant has more tez than we need, and splitting
   it into two slices, appending the first slice to the end of
   'current_auction', and the second one to back to the front of
   'queued_slices'.

   While doing this, we also need to pass this information to the
   burrow. And make sure that it references the new slices rather
   than the original.

   (NOTE, an idea for efficiently handling splits on burrow side:
    We can do that by maintaining another 'split_slices' queue
    storing a FIFO queue of (original_leaf, first_half, second_half) triplets
    within the burrow. When a burrow is traversing it's liquidation slices,
    it has to check it against the head of the 'split_slices' queue, and
    replace it by the split counterparts if it matches.)

   Alternatively, we should store burrows slices within an AVL tree, then
   we can efficiently replace a slice with two new slices eagerly.

3. Then an auction starts:

   > If there are any lots waiting to be auctioned, Checker starts an open,
   > ascending bid auction. There is a reserve price set at tz_t which declines
   > exponentially over time as long as no bid as been placed. Once a bid
   > is placed, the auction continues. Every bid needs to improve over the
   > previous bid by at least 0.33 cNp and adds the longer of 20 blocks or
   > 20 minutes, to the time before the auction expires.

   TODO: Figure out how a `bid` should be represented as.

   Every bid here is either ends as a 'leading_bid' in 'current_auction', or in
   'unclaimed_bids' set when overbid.

   At any time, the owner of a bid can claim an bid if it is in 'unclaimed_bid'
   set. If it is, it is removed and the amount of kit is given back.

   When an auction expires, the current auction is both moved to 'completed_auctions'
   FIFO queue, and to another map from tree_ptr to auction_outcome called `outcomes`.

4. When a burrow is touched, it checks if the head of its slices belongs to
   a completed auction or not. This can be checked via the 'find_root'
   function of AVL trees. If we end up in 'queued_slices' or 'curent_auction',
   it is not complete, if not, it means that we're in 'completed_auctions'.

   If the slice is completed, then the burrows outstanding kit balance is
   adjusted (FIXME, clarify, quite a bit of stuff to do on burrow side,
   but AFAIK they are already implemented) and the leaf is deleted from
   the tree.

   If the deletion causes the tree to become empty, then the tree is popped from
   `outcomes` map, and the leading bid is moved to `unclaimed_bid` set.

5. When checker is touched, it fetches the oldest auction from `completed_auctions`
   queue, and processes a few of oldest liquidations via touching their burrows. This
   is to clean-up the slices that haven't been claimed for some reason.

NOTE: !!! Below code does not yet completely reflect the above process.

Notes on data structures:

* When we need a queue we can prepend and append, we can simply use a
((int, 't) bigmap, int, int) triplet, where the bigmap contains consecutive
integer keys, and we also store the bounds of the keys of the map. Prepending
and appending (and maybe updating) can be done efficiently.

* If we use an AVL tree as a queue, then we also have the ability to delete or
insert elements in the middle. However, this requires us to write our AVL tree
more generically, and also much slower than the above method. So I don't think
we should do this.
